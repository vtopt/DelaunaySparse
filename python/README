A Python3 wrapper for the DELAUNAYSPARSE Fortran package.


REQUIREMENTS:

  Python3.6+ with numpy package installed.
  A Fortran compiler that supports BIND(C) and compiling shared objects.
  The Python wrapper builds ".so" objects, and therefore only supports
  Mac and Linux systems.

USAGE:

  Update the configuration of the machine-specific Fortran compiler
  and BLAS / LAPACK link commands (or use local blas.f lapack.f)
  in the file "delsparse.py".

  Now, in Python3.6+ code the Fortran package can be accessed by

    import delsparse

  with accompanying documentation built-in through the `help` command

    help(delsparse)

  and it is assumed that Fortran-contiguous NumPy arrays will be the
  vessel for data entering and exiting the Fortran module. An example
  Python script is provided in `example.py`. That script also defines a
  convenience wrapper that converts C-style (row major) sets of points
  into Fortran-style (column major) sets of points.
